### About me:

Hi, I'm Bucky Wolfe. I'm primarily a VoIP Engineer of 10+ yrs, with a smattering of "Network Engineer", "Software Engineer" and "SRE" experience.
I love working with open source telecom stuff, bending routers in ways they shouldn't be bent, and general linux tomfoolery.

- ðŸ‘” I help small ISPs / ITSPs find their niche and bootstrap their infrastructure.
- ðŸŒŽ I live in Vinh, Vietnam 
- âŒš Most Active Hours: 9pm - 11am @ `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` (9am - 11pm @ `America/Chicago`, sans DST).

### What I'm up to: 

+ Currently embedded with a US-based VoIP Company, building a residential telecom network & property management system.
+ Broadening my experience with embedded dev, tinkering with building an FXS gateway. (Pet project, not a paying thing)
+ Planning a project to hopefully bolster interest in F/OSS Telecom.
